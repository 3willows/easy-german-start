# Easy German Start

You don't know where to start German? Start here!

It doesn't make your German fluent. However, you willl find yourself being familar with German more while solving quizzes on `Easy German Start`.

When it comes to learning languages, the most challenge part is that you don't know you're doing well or not. If it is your first time learning languages, it would be more challenging. It's the same for me.

The way I see it, there are four steps in the journey of learning languages.

1. Memorize some basic vocabulary and be familiar with the target language - A1, A2

2. After being familar with the language, study grammer and practice speaking, listening, reading and writing with any method you prefer. It's really depending on your preference. - A2, B1

3. Now, you've started to enjoy activities and contents in your target language even though there are misunderstanding and a lot of mistakes. Just enjoy things in the target language as much as you can. - B1, B2

4. Now, you can call you fluent in the language. The next journey will be different depending on your goal. You may be satisfied on your current level or you may want to study more to get into a school, work, or whatever you want.

In those steps, it helps you to overcome the first step.
